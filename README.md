# EagleVision

Advanced drone and satellite imagery analysis system for object detection, tracking, and terrain analysis.

## Overview

EagleVision is a powerful Java/Spring Boot application designed to process and analyze imagery from drones and satellites. The system uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to automatically detect objects, track changes over time, and provide actionable intelligence from aerial and satellite imagery.

## Key Features

- Automatic object detection (vehicles, buildings, personnel)
- Change detection between temporal imagery
- Movement pattern analysis
- Object classification and counting
- Terrain and obstacle mapping
- Geolocation and georeferencing
- Multi-source data fusion
- Alert system for detected changes

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, JavaCV
- **Machine Learning**: DL4J, pre-trained models
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (H2 for development)
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf (MVP), React (planned)
- **Geospatial**: GeoTools, PostGIS
